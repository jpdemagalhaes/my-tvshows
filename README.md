# My TVShows [WIP]
A simple react app to provide a way for the user to manage the TV shows that are being watched at the moment

## Getting Started

To install dependencies and run the dev environment

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This simple app runs on json-server. So to get it started you'll also need to run

```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
```
